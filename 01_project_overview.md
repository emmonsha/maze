# Project Overview

## What is the Maze Project?

The Maze Project is an educational application that demonstrates several important computer science concepts through a maze generation, solving, and visualization system. The project combines algorithmic thinking, GUI development, web development, and machine learning concepts.

## Core Components

### 1. Maze Generation
- **Eller's Algorithm**: Creates "perfect" mazes (mazes with exactly one path between any two points)
- **Cave Generation**: Uses cellular automata to create cave-like structures
- **File I/O**: Load and save mazes in a specific format

### 2. Maze Solving
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path through a maze
- **Path Visualization**: Displays the solution visually

### 3. User Interfaces
- **Desktop GUI**: Built with pygame
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning agent that learns to solve mazes
- **Cave Generation**: Using cellular automata with configurable parameters

## Key Requirements

1. **Maze Generation**: Create perfect mazes using Eller's algorithm
2. **Maze Solving**: Find and display the shortest path between any two points
3. **GUI Interface**: Visual representation with pygame
4. **Web Interface**: MPA/SPA using Flask
5. **Cave Generation**: Cellular automaton implementation
6. **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning for maze solving

## Learning Objectives

By following this project, you'll learn:
- Advanced algorithm implementation (Eller's algorithm, BFS)

- **Flask**: For web interface
- **NumPy**: For mathematical operations
- **JSON**: For data exchange in web interface
- **Collections module**: For BFS algorithm implementation
